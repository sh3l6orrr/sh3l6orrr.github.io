                <h4 class="d-inline-block">Mediocrity.</h4> <br>
                <i>Nietzsche said: "A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity."</i>

                    We've been told "everyone is unique in his/her own way" all the time. But come on, you know that is a lie. It's one of the many facts that are politically incorrect.
                    <br><br>
                    I never see a hint of how everyone is unique. Walking down the streets, thousands of pedestrians pass you by everyday, most of them cannot be more ordinary. They follow the same fashions, watch the same dramas, and because they watched the same media or talk shows, they comment the same thing on politics frivolously, despite they know nothing outside their tiny bubbles. Different people behave in such a replicable way, which is why big data can predict their behaviors so accurately. Just like the food McDonald's make from day to day, people demonstrate a shocking amount of invariance. To celebrate this shameful resemblance, people invented a tool called MBTI and proudly classified themsleves into 16 separate categories. You didn't hear me wrong, they try to sort the 7 billion population on earth into merely 16 laughable categories and took pride in their achievements!

                    However, being mediocre is not anyone's fault, it's just so natural a thing that everyone is used to. But strangely enough, I've always had trouble in getting used to this aspect of life: I watched popular TV shows and became tired of them and tried to follow celebrities and found that to be so pointless. I would rather become a celeebrity myself than chase after other celebrities. I always thought myself the one different and I hated to disappear into the crowd. Even sometimes I got embarrassed in front of people but I still think that's so much better that staying quiet and being a nobody. Well, I always wanted to be somebody. There are so much things I can bear in life, hot weather fine, cheap food fine, a cat breaking my iPad fine, but being treated as a meaningless symbol that can be replaced at any time isn't fine to the utmost degree.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't really know what life really is. To some people it's a journey to experience, to others it's a delegation of religious service. But both sounds unappealing to me. From time to time I feel that what we think is reality is actually an illusion created by our minds, or even we could just be giant biochemical compounds who believes that we have free will, in a way full of conceitedness. Regardless, we only live once, anyone of us, since at least I've never heard of anyone with empirical evidence who caould bring his/her memory from past life. Thus, we have no choice but to cherish what we have, and it becomes crucial how we spend the mere one hundred year span, which is a tiny fraction of the eternality of the universe, of human life.

                    I don't know, but here, it's just a little hard for me to find a comrade who shares the same sentiments. Insomnia hunts my mind, in 3:41 pm's Los Angeles, I am the only person alive.
