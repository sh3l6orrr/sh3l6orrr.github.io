                <h4 class="d-inline-block">A new branch of mathematics.</h4> <br>

                <i>Immanuel Kant said: "I call all knowledge transcendental if it is occupied, not with objects, but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them." In this article, I argue for the necessity of a branch of Mathematics that serves the basis of the social sciences field, just like in the natural sciences, how waves are based on differential equations, how stresses are based on tensors, and how cryptology is based on number theory. </i><br><br><br>
                <p>    
                    Rather than empirical knowledge, Mathematics is better described as a framework that could fit physical reality. By 'fit' not only do I mean it can describe reality, but I also mean it can predict reality. For example, the developement of the theory of imaginary numbers preceded the laws of electric circuits or quantum mechanics, which used imaginary numbers extensively. Hence, it makes sense to say Mathematics transcends Physics. For another example, Higgs Boson was predicted to exist by its Mathematical model before it's proven to exist just several years ago. <br><br>

                    Unlike the sciences, which can be verified by devising experiments, Mathematics is purely constructed by axioms and logic derivations, which means that in nature, the validity of a Mathematical theorem differs greatly from the validity of a scientific law: it is absolutely definite and would never alter in any situtation. Therefore, Mathematics is not a science. By a very interesting comparision, metaphysics is not a science as well, because apparently it doesn't have right or wrong, and it's focus revolves around debate and convincing. <br><br>

                    It is interesting to notice that unlike the natural sciences, which are strictly based on Mathematical formulations, the social sciences does not have any strong foundations. Just because of such a deficiency, most of the social sciences theories are descriptive and segmented, lacking a clear structure, and they are also stationary since they derive their validity solely from experiments, which I don't think is a reliable and consistent way of getting precise knowledge. This is also why in social sciences, there aren't many established 'laws' but only 'theories', although the nature of our physical world hints at the existence of more definite conclusions.  <br><br>
                    
                    Therefore, I believe it is a must that a system of Mathematics that specifically serves as the foundation for the social sciences be developed. I have <a href="https://sh3l6orrr.github.io/social_sciences_laws.html">certain proposed laws</a> of psychology and sociology, which might be better supported with a Mathematical foundation.
