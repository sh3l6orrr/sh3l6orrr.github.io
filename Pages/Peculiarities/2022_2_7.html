                <p>    
                    Human civilization has been around for more than 8000 years, since the oldest Egyptians. However, in no time period in history had things changed so <i>dramatically</i> as the past three centuries. We went from a traditional lifestyle to modernized humans. The world economy grows exponentially after the science revolutions, if you are curious enough to get convinced by looking at a nice GDP chart. Why so? <br><br>
                    It turns out humans are really not just <i>animals</i>. We are much better than them. We not only sense the world but also use rationalism to think. We not only try to survive but try to find out how nature works. Yes, humans have conquered the nature, at least partially. Meteorologists were able to predict when it's going to rain to better schedule our lives. Legislators continuously optimize our government to achieve the best efficiency. Physicists were even able to build intricate circuits that automates labor. All of these are not trivial, but reveals how humans are curious about the world and its inner workings.<br><br> 
                    But how did we begin to make these great achievements? Why in the first place someone tried to calculate the value of pi? It wsn't because of money or fame, or of some other vulgar reasons. It's because we are truly baffled, by all the intricacy around us, and yet we are genuinely not yielding to whoever created this maze. We are now diverging from the theists. We both marvel at the grandness of nature, but as thinkers we did more. Challenge accepted, said the first pioneers in discovering the nature's secrets and again and again they've made noises. That is the spirit of them. They looked into the abstract from the apparent. They find out rules and doubted the rules. That's what fueled the spirit of science to pass on and on, to keep going and believing. <br><br>
                    We are not players in the game anymore, but deconstructers. We are aware to be in a meticulously designed system, and try to break through it. Awareness is starting to poputate among all of us, and it continuous to be. Good luck then, as it's a definitely a great and meaningful journey.<br><br>
